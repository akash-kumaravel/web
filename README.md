This contains everything you need to run your app locally.
## SEO Notes

- Add `https://memoinfotech.com/sitemap.xml` to Google Search Console (Sitemaps) to help Google discover pages.
- Ensure `robots.txt` (root) references the sitemap — it's added in this repo.
- We added Organization JSON-LD in `index.html` and breadcrumb JSON-LD on primary pages.
- Per-page titles and descriptions are set dynamically in the React pages.

If you want, I can also add server-side rendering or `react-helmet-async` for more robust meta handling.
